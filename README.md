# fileOrganiser.py

This is a basic file organiser that I made. In no way is it complete or even remotely perfect but it was a challenge for me and a way to test my current skills.

The program will navigate to the users profile folder using the pathlib module in Python 3.

To run the program, download the ZIP file for fileOrganiser. Extract the contents to wherever you want.

Once extracted go in the fileOrganiser folder, then the dist folder, then another fileOrganiser folder and then find the fileOrganiser.exe

Run that bad boy and check your Documents folder afterwards.

I do want to make it better but it is what it is for now.

# organiser.py

This is a more free-choice variant of fileOrganiser. I've been tinkering with tkinter, and what I created was a small program that allows the user to choose which file or folder to move and where to move it.

organiser.py contains only the code I wrote and will not work until I make an .exe with pyinstaller. I have yet to design the window properly, and the program is just a simple window.
